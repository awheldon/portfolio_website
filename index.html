        <h2>I have recently completed a Software Engineering 3-month bootcamp at General Assembly to transition from my previous career in Account Management in the advertising production world.<br/>I have been involved in delivering campaigns for clients large and small, I wanted to find a new career that truly lined up with my passions. I am now immersed in the world of coding and all things web development, and look to find a new role within a supportive team that I can continue on my accelerated path.</h2>

        <h1>General Assembly Project One - Tetris</h1>
        <article>Given a list of games to recreate, I chose what was highlighted as one of the harder ones, Tetris - the requirements were to build with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. Although undertaken with less than 3 weeks of formal instruction, was a great first experience of software development, with the frustrations of not knowing the way to progress, to the elation of coming up with truly independent solutions to the problems presented.</article>

        <h1>General Assembly Project Two - Harry Potter Quiz</h1>
        <article>First proper experience of pair-coding, in a ‘hackathon’ setting with a 36 hour time constraint, using the React library. My partner and I settled on coding our own quiz using the Harry Potter API, with details of the Harry Potter universe. Very proud of the final result that we produced via pair coding, having sketched out the functionality so that we had a clear approach to make the most of our short amount of time.</article>

        <h1>General Assembly Project Three - Accountable</h1>
        <article>For our first full stack app, my group settled on tackling a ‘Splitwise’ clone. This involved building a MongoDB database, with an Express API to serve the data from it and consumed with a separate front-end built with React. My group thoroughly planned from the outset, to have a manageable timeline to work against. As it was our first time working with a backend, we tackled it all together in a pair (or trio) coding environment. When it came to the frontend, we divided up the work, with myself taking the responsibility of all the expenses functionality. Learned a lot about full stack development during the short amount of time, especially when it came to planning, as we built so much functionality in the backend that was not required in the end, but valuable in the lessons we learnt.</article>

        <h1>General Assembly Project Four - Golfr</h1>
        <article>Solo project, building a full stack app with a Python/Django backend. Keen to stretch myself on my final project, I decided to tackle it solo and solidify all my learnings of the course. I built a website for finding and rating golf courses, and keeping track of scores with an inbuilt scorecard. The front end was built with React, but I decided to use a new (to myself) framework with Bootstrap, to deviate from the reliance on Bulma up until that point. Enjoyed the frustrations of learning new technologies, at the same time as strengthening my skills taught during the course.</article>
